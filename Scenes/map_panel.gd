# TODO add panels to an array, add "spawn coordinates" to panels,
# move around the levels based on which level you're in (center on the current level),
# spawn loaded levels so that their used spawnpoint overlaps with
# the corresponding exit's nearby spawnpoint in the previous level.
# this will work because exits' ids match the ids of nearby spawns.
# don't draw the spawn 0 of level 0.
# don't forget to check if all ids match.
# for every level, make the spawnpoit as close to camera boundry as possible,
# or maybe even on it sometimes. thus, level exit areas should be outside of
# the visible area...
# maybe the map data should be stored in a singleton or something. we shan't render
# it all the time, clearly, so we could store data in a singleton and re-render
# the map every time we need to see it.
