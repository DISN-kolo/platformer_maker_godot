# TODO
- Killzones! need to have last player position on ground saved, then
- Saves :)
- multilayer tileset:
	- background stuff (? maybe do a painting and that's it?)
	- foreground uninteractible decor elements (?)
- Completed rooms, accessible rooms, inaccessible barriers in rooms...
- Various tilesets (because background/foreground matters)
- Character animations
- Intro act (big goal!)

# Some specs
- Jump height allows for jumping just over 3 tiles
- N-times jump based upon whatever you specify. By default grows by 2 when you pick up the boots
- Levels from base level, connectable by exit nodes and spawn nodes (please do match the ids in the names) (quite intuitive, really)

# misc notes
- maybe the exit area node thing would work with exporting a collision shape instead of a shape

# TODOs that'd be too out of scope for this, but fun to think about
- Levels need to be positioned somehow. Level graph is required.
Maybe it's gonna be useful to make it as a scene that's only accissble from the editor, in order to position levels n stuff.
Furthermore, this sounds like a plan for a tool creation!
